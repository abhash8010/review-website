	<h1>Welcome to the Drexel reviews!</h1>
	<h4>
		Students, Professors, and anyone on the Drexel Campus can rate and review anything they purchase right here! From food to residential halls to parties- name it and you can review it. Ratings and reviews are public so everyone could decide which products are the best with your help! You can recommend food you love so others can experience its savoriness too! Or, you can tell others to avoid something so they donâ€™t get ripped off! With your help, we can make the Drexel Experience better than it already is!



		Tired of wasting money on poor products and food? Look no further than the Drexel Review Website.
