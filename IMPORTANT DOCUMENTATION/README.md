The files in the repository are dependent upon each other and are named as such to visually see these connections. 
The main HTML files are separated into either residential hall or dining hall folders. 

Naming Convention for Internal Documentation:
- The .html and .php files make the main outline of each web page. 
- In the main directory, there are templates for the residential halls and the dining halls that outline the general webpages. 
    - These templates are labeled as such and include the CSS, HTML, and Javascript code that was needed for each web page. 
- The login.ph directory contains files needed to make the login system work.
- Files that begin with “dbh” connect the main website to the local database.
- Files that begin with “comment” contain the functions needed to send data that the user types in the comment section 
to the database and retrieve the data when needed.

The Drexel Rating Website is dependent on XAMPP and PHPMyAdmin

XAMPP allows your browser to connect to the website and transfer data to the database.

PHPMyAdmin sets up the database for the website and allows data to be remembered upon reloading.
